A website to coordinate civics without coercive authority

## Purpose

There are many areas of public life that unfortunately lend themselves
to individuals acting selfishly or in a mean-spirited manner, and this
tradgey is compunded by the fact that it often happens in precisely
the areas where it is most crutial for cooperation.  

Many of us are aware of the so-called market failures.  Civics is
/supposed/ to be the entire sets of privileges /and responsibilities/
of people in public life.  Charity, blogging, and campaigning can all
be examples of positive civic engagement, but generally these knoble
efforts are thwarted by asymetric information, unreliable reputation
management, unenforable property rights, and a slew of other
problems. 

A few of us are aware that some have been resolved at least in part.
One examle is public radio broadcasting.  By bundling a negative
extarnality, comercials, with a positive externality, music, a
business model was shown viable.  the use of market-regulated
insurance companies to align the interests of the knowledgeable
specialists of the insurance company with the interests of the lay
insured, insurance companies have solved, /in principle/, much of the
information asymmetry market failure.

## Part of the Solution

This is meant to be driven by principals of business and thoughtful
commited people in the civic sphere to encourage the mass of people to
behave in civics more like we do when privately acountable for our own
actions and less like voters do in politcs who seek other people's
money and privilege until civilization has swalled all of its own tail
and most of the body.

Here are some possibilites to explore here with the aim of getting us
closer to a humanitarian ideal:

* Make volunteer work easier
  * The charity should be reviewed by trusted locals
* Make homeschooling economics, history, law, etc easier
  * The ciriculum should be reviewed by trusted experts
* Make useful campaign work simpler
  * Identify those who have above average knowledge of civics in
    economics, law, etc who are also eager to engage
	* Send these people targeted communication regarding open politcal
      positions and campaign opportunities
* Teach workers basic economics and more to help them be happy
  productive workers who don't undermine our efforts at the voting
  booth

I would prefer to work with people who aren't voting and acting to
undermine civilization than the usual choice - how about you?
